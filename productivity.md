# at the table: productivity

## Definition/Explanation
Productivity and focus are two important aspects of our ability to work efficiently and effectively. Productivity refers to the amount of work we are able to accomplish in a given amount of time, while focus refers to our ability to concentrate on a task without getting distracted. In order to optimize our productivity and focus, we need to consider a variety of factors, including our physical environment, the lighting and noise levels in our workspace, and our own personal habits and preferences. By making small changes to our workspace and daily routine, we can improve our ability to focus and get more done in less time.

## Scientific Background
Phase 1: From waking up to 8hrs later: 
		○ high levels of dopamine and norepinephrine.
		○ State of high alertness.
		○ Light the environment as much as we can. Overhead light is great. 
		○ Analytical and focused work. 
		○ Sunlight is the best way to activate the brain and body. Sunlight thru the window is 50times less effective than without the window.
Phase 2: from 8hrs after waking to 16hrs
		○ Bring down levels of light. Dim the lamps and screens.
		○ State: high serotonin.
			§ Better for abstract and creative thinking
Phase 3: pre sleep and sleep. 
		○ Limit bright light. Just to the amount that is safe. Light:
			§ It depletes melatonin levels
			§ Shifts circadian clock: the body suffers jet lag. 

The optimum focus is *up to* 90 minutes.

## Protocols & Examples
Sustaining focus = being able to bring your attention back when it drifts. The average adult can sustain unbroken attention for no more than 3 minutes; do not expect your focus to be uniform while working.
	1. Bright lights during phase 1 of the day.
	2. Place visual focus direct in front of you. Restricted visual window. 
	3. Put screens at nose level (at least).
	4. Avoid reclining, it's a sleep posture.
	5. Half stand and half sited work.
	6. Avoid white noise.
	7. Pursue 40 hertz binaural beats during work bout or prior to work bout.
        ○ Binaural beats: the difference between the two patterns of beats that are listened by each ear leads.
		○ Best frequency: 40 hertz. Optimal for learning, memory and recall. 
	8. Stationary tread mill increases alertness and focus. 
	9. Cathedral effect: focused and analytical work: low ceiling space. Creative work: high ceiling environment.
	10. Limit interruptions
	11. Changing environments might be beneficial. 
    12. Where we look and levels of alertness are highly correlated. 
		○ When we look down the neurons trigger calmness and sleep.
		○ When we look up the neurons trigger the activation of alertness. 
    13. Screen should be at least to nose level.
	14. Bringing your visual to a narrow space enhances focus. 
	15. Make sure that whatever you are looking at is straight in front of your eyes. 
	16. If i look into a narrow space, they create alertness but also require energy, so it's demanding.
	17. For every 45 minutes focused on something narrow, get 5 minutes of relaxing eyes (ideally, take a walk).
    18. When we are standing up, locus coeruleus neurons become more active (they become even more active when moving). This activates alertness. 
	19. Never do: sit down and immediately focus on something (unless you are stressed or highly motivated). 
	20. Expect 6 minutes to "warm up" the alertness and focus. 
    21. Avoid: Air conditioner noise or heat generating noise. White noise can cause impairments in development of auditory system in children.

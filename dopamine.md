# Dopamine

## Definition/Explanation
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in reward, pleasure, motivation, and drive.


## Scientific Background
Dopamine is a neuromodulatory neurotransmitter that alters neuronal signaling and mediates motivation and reward anticipation, rather than pleasure per se. 

Dopamine is secreted preceding rewards and declines to baseline levels upon reward attainment. While dopamine release can be elicited by innate rewards such as gustation, sex, thermoregulation, and thermal comfort, it is also highly subjective and can be provoked by rewards that are perceived as valuable. 

Dopamine transmission is also stimulated by errors or incorrect responses, which may benefit overall learning objectives. Furthermore, brief periods of study or skill acquisition can increase dopamine release. However, pharmacological agents that substantially elevate dopamine, such as amphetamines or cocaine, can damage dopaminergic pathways, disrupting neuroplasticity and cognitive functions including learning and memory.  

Dopamine dynamics, encompassing peaks, troughs, and baseline dopamine levels, determine baseline motivation, confidence, and well-being. Elucidating these dopaminergic mechanisms may help optimize both mental and physical health, in addition to performance and productivity.

At a neurophysiological level, dopamine modulates various neural circuits and pathways. For example, dopamine interacts with brainstem nuclei and efferent nerves regulating immune responses and inflammation. It can also act on nociceptive circuits to transform the perception of pain into pleasure. Moreover, dopamine signaling influences circuits underlying movement, motivation, and craving. 

Dopamine can be released through either localized synaptic transmission between neurons or diffuse volumetric release in the brain and body. While increased dopamine levels may temporarily enhance motivation and arousal, they can also produce transient motivational states.

## Protocols & Examples

#### Do NOTs
- Avoid layering too many sources of dopamine if your goal is to consistently feel motivated (you will crash afterward):
Dopamine stacking, which is the combination of multiple stimuli to increase dopamine release, can be detrimental to your dopamine baseline and peak levels. While it's okay to stack multiple stimuli for exercise or mental work every once in a while, it's important to avoid doing it consistently. Combining highly caffeinated energy drinks, loud music, and intense workouts can lead to a dopamine crash, which can drive your baseline lower and lower. It's crucial to be cautious about not stacking too many stimuli for dopamine too often. Additionally, be mindful of how often you take or do things that amplify your dopamine levels and how many different dopamine-stimulating behaviors or compounds you stack. It's essential to be strategic and avoid playing the same motivational card too often, as it can lose its effect. Finally, be careful not to overstimulate your system by way of too much adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, as it can lead to adrenal insufficiency syndrome.
- Lack of sleep
- Reduce behaviors that chronically overstimulate dopamine like compulsive internet use, porn use, or recreational drug use. These can desensitize dopamine pathways and make it harder to release dopamine in response to everyday rewards and events. 

#### Behavioral Protocols
- Put emphasis on the process - dopamine release is partially controlled by mindset.
- *Engaging in activities that are intrinsically rewarding rather than relying on extrinsic rewards*. Do things that you find intrinsically motivating and pleasurable like gaining knowledge, problem solving, music, social interaction, and acts of kindness. This trains your brain to release more dopamine.
- NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest)
- Cold Exposure (Cold water immersion or cold shower).Taking a cold shower, swimming in cold water, or just exposing your face and hands to cold can activate dopamine pathways. Start with 30-60 seconds of cold and build up slowly.
- Sunlight exposure. Exposure to bright light during the day, especially sunlight, stimulates dopamine release and helps set your circadian rhythm. Try to get 30-60 minutes of natural light exposure per day.
- Exercise. Both cardio exercise and strength/resistance training can boost dopamine production and transmission. Even light activity like walking or yoga can help.
- Random intermittent reinforcement, - i.e., celebrate your wins, but not all of them
- *Sleep 7-9 hrs* Lack of sleep can significantly deplete dopamine levels.

#### Supplements
- Caffeine ingestion
1-3mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight. For a 48kg person, that would be 48-144mg of caffeine.

# Motivation, Drive, Focus, Dopamine, and Satisfaction

## Definition/Explanation
Motivation, drive, and focus are all tightly linked to the neurochemistry of movement, and the same molecule, dopamine, is responsible for all three. Dopamine is not about pleasure, but rather about motivation, craving, and pursuit of goals or things that are outside our immediate possession and experience. It promotes mental and physical motivation, drive, and pursuit, and to some extent, focus. However, caution should be taken when using stimulants to enhance motivation and focus, as over time, it can deplete dopamine levels and undermine motivation and drive.


## Scientific Background
Dopamine is a neuromodulator that controls and promotes motivation, drive, and pursuit, and to some extent, focus. It is not just about pleasure, but rather about the pursuit of goals or things that are outside our immediate possession and experience. People with ADHD can focus selectively on things that they are interested in, but they may struggle with convergent thinking, which is necessary for implementing creative ideas. Stimulants like energy drinks, pre-workout drinks, and drugs like Adderall and Ritalin can deplete dopamine levels over time, which can lead to challenges with motivation and drive. Caffeine, on the other hand, can upregulate dopamine receptors and make dopamine more accessible or functional within the biochemistry and pathways of the brain and body.


## Protocols & Examples
 While caffeine can be good for the dopamine system, energy drinks and pre-workouts can deplete dopamine levels over time, leading to challenges with motivation and drive. Intermittent spiking of dopamine is the way to go for enhancing motivation and focus in the long run.
 
To sustain motivation for goals, leverage the dopamine system by inconsistently rewarding yourself for progress. Anticipate and think about failure to generate motivation, but also check in with yourself weekly and reward yourself cognitively for being on the right track. This helps maintain motivation and readiness to continue pursuing your goals. Additionally, consider using visual strategies like vision boards or lists to help define and remind yourself of your goals.

#### Focus: 
- Supplements: such as Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine, creatine, and omega-3s, which can directly modulate the neural circuits for concentration and focus.
- Sleep optimization: getting enough sleep is critical for mental and physical function overall, and can improve focus and concentration.
- Deliberate decompression and defocusing: taking a period of time each day to daydream, walk down the hall without looking at your phone, or not incorporate more sensory information can allow your brain to focus better when you return to a bout of focused work.

#### Satisfaction:
- the importance of being process-oriented and present-focused rather than solely goal-oriented in order to find fulfillment in life
- having freedom of choice can lead to happiness, but once a choice is made, having all other options killed off can increase satisfaction.
- gratitude practice and how it can lead to neuroplasticity and increased happiness
